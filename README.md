# Data-Analytics-Project-with-Power-BI

## Inroduction
We will use a real-world dataset from AtliQ Technologies for this end-to-end data analytics project, with an emphasis on employee attendance during a three-month period. In order to assist the HR team in understanding employee attendance trends, we will build a Power BI dashboard. This useful, job-worthy project makes use of real data and provides a hands-on introduction to real-world analytics.

## DataSet

The dataset used in this project is sourced from AtliQ Technologies and contains employee attendance information over a three-month period, from April to June, aligning with the company's fiscal year. This real-world dataset will be analyzed to provide key insights into employee presence and attendance patterns during this three months.
