# Data-Analytics-Project-with-Power-BI

## Inroduction
We will use a real-world dataset from AtliQ Technologies for this end-to-end data analytics project, with an emphasis on employee attendance during a three-month period. In order to assist the HR team in understanding employee attendance trends, we will build a Power BI dashboard. This useful, job-worthy project makes use of real data and provides a hands-on introduction to real-world analytics.
